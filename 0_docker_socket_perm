Docker socker permissions issues:
---------------------------------
- First, check the docker permissions

ls -la /var/run/docker.sock

from the above command, ensure to have permissions of the socker to be 'srw-rw-rw-' or '666'
if not change the mode of the socker to be '666'

- Check for the presently operating user is added to 'docker' group or not

	groups

if not, add the user to the group

	sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins

- check if added

	groups

if the above command still show as below
'jenkins docker'

then add 'jenkins' to be 'primarily' in the 'docker' group

	newgrp docker

The above command adds 'jenkins' user's primary group as 'docker' and will have full permissions on the socket
